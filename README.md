This repository demonstrates a common type mismatch error in TypeScript. The `add` function is defined to accept two numbers, but in the usage, a string is passed as a parameter. This leads to a compilation error highlighting the type mismatch. The solution provides a corrected version of the function that handles potential type errors and allows for string input, converting it to a number before the addition.
